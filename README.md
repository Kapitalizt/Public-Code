# Public-Code
Some code I think others might find useful.

.GENERATE RANDOM is gives you six different options to generate a (pseudo) random sequence of some sort. This can either be:
- String: ALL LOWERCASE OF QUANTITY (N)
- String: ALL UPPERCASE OF QUANTITY (N)
- String: ALL LETTERS OF QUANTITY (N)
- String: ALL DIGITS OF QUANTITY (N)
- String: ALL PUNCTUATION OF QUANTITY (N)
- Array:  AN ARRAY OF SIZE (N) OF NUMBERS BETWEEN BOUNDS (P) AND (Q)

When selecting the Array options, if the upper bound is lower than the lower bound, they are reversed and the lower becomes the upper.
